## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

## (a) asks:

For each pair of items $i,j\in\{1,2,...,56\}$, compute the shortest time $d_ij$ to go from item $i$ to item $j$, and store these values. You may not use any optimization software to answer this question. Compute also the shortest time to travel between the start/end location and any item.
